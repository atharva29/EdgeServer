# EdgeServer
This edge server will be an updated version for the previous Edge and S3 at the cloud Server.
Currently this Edge will act as the HTTP websocket server and TCP server.

React will save only certain amount of data in its state.

After Clicking Download button on React the http request will go the server that will then execute command of sqlite3 which will
ultimately genrate excel for that file in specified file.
